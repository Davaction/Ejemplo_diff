I think there is nothing like this cute cat, I’m sure that if we manage to tame it, that kitten will be the best! But what will happen if they cannot catch it, he will be lost in the streets for ever, moving between dumpsters eating trash and rotten food,
and getting full of worms and fleas, or maybe being hit by a truck (She starts crying and takes a glass of wine to calm down).

-Man: We filmed everything! The eagle took him to its nest, and then the cat battle with the eagle’s offspring and managed to escape!
-Woman: That is incredible! 
-Man: And that’s not all, back in the city streets, that stubborn cat battled two dogs and got them on the run scared of its claws and fighting abilities that did lots of scratches on their faces. 
-Woman: Wow!
-Man: And that’s just the beginning! This naughty cat also fell into a sewer and appeared several miles away in another neighborhood, and also fell from a second-floor and survived to then manage to avoid been trapped by the rescue team!
-Woman: What kind of critter is that?
-Man: This is not a regular cat, it also went through a shooting area and managed to dodge several arrows, and then survived crossing several avenues full of cars. I don’t even know how this cat still alive and injury free after all of that.

-Man: We lost track of the cat, the team is confused and they don’t know where it went, the GPS cannot locate it anymore. -Woman (kind of loses control) You useless  thing let me  talk  to one of the team members. 
-Worker: Hello! 
-Women (Screaming): What kind of incompetent team are you? Now go back to work and do whatever you need to do to find it!  

Scene V
The team keeps searching for the cat but their efforts seem to be futile.
-Man: Now what are we going to do?
-Worker: I got an idea, this is kind of desperate but it is our last chance!
-Man: What is it?
-Worker: Lets put pictures of the cat in different parts of the city, send images to newspapers, magazines, TV, and radio stations. This cat seemed to have been evaporated from the earth’s surface, and our high tech electronic devices cannot detect it. 
 -Man: Ok, lets do it! 

Scene VI
The man arrives at the house tired, dirty, and with his clothes torn apart. The woman opens the door and gets scared at his sight.
-Woman: What happened?
-Man: This is really weird, the cat seems to have been evaporated but we’re trying a new strategy. 
-Woman: What is it?
-Man: We’re asking help from different communication media and for today we cannot do anything else different from waiting until tomorrow to know the campaign results. 
-Woman: But how this team can be such a failure! 
-Man: Darling, they’re not a failure, the thing is that this kitty is an escapist genius. 
-Woman: I hope tomorrow you all have better luck! For now lets go to sleep!

Scene VII 
The next day the man wakes up in a hurry takes breakfast, and since he already built a friendship with the rescue team, they call him and tell him where they’re going to be to resume the rescue and search process. The man leaves in a hurry.
-Man: Ok I’m leaving! I’m positive today we’re going to get it!
-Woman: I hope so! 
-Man: I will be giving you updates! 
-Woman: All right! You better! 

Scene VIII 
The man arrives to the rescue team meeting. 
-Man: How is everything going?
-Worker: We’ve been receiving a lot of different kinds of information about the cat, some said that they saw the cat walking around their garden, others say that it was hanging out in a tree close to their park’s neighborhood, some say that they saw it at a veterinary with an arrow crossing his neck, others said that they saw it roaming around the train station, and others said that they saw the cat in the neighbor's house and that they think they might have adopted it, and all this information comes not only from within the state but from all over the country. 
-Man(Makes a confusing face): This is getting even uglier! -Worker: We are feeling very overwhelmed, we never faced a situation like this before, and we’re not sure how to proceed. -Man: I think that the only way the cat could have ended up in another state, is because somebody took it there in a car. -Worker(Making a confusing face): What to do?
-Man: I think that the first thing to do is to attend to the in-state information, because it is less likely that somebody took the cat away in a car. 
-Worker: Ok, lets start scheduling appointments! 

Scene IX 
The woman is looking through the window when her phone rings! -Man: Hello! I have some good news!
-Woman: Tell me about it! 
-Man: Things are moving on and we have lots of information.
-Woman: Oh I’m glad to hear that!
-Man: I’ll call you later with more information!
-Woman: I’ll be waiting until then!

Scene x
The rescue team arrives and talks to the man.
-Worker: We already went to several of the information sources, but all the cats that we found were similar to your cat, but they’re not our cat. Now what? I think at this point we are going to abandon the project. 
-Man: I also don’t know what to do at this point! I’m very disappointed but understand your situation, maybe is OK that you give up, you already have done enough.
 


Scene XI
The man  again arrives at the house tired and dirty. The woman opens the door and due to his appearance and attitude, she already can infer the bad news. 
-Woman: Don’t tell me, I already know! It was a failure! 
-Man: They did all they could to find it, but this kitty simply seemed to have vanished over the earth’s face, this kitty is really a thing. 
-Woman(starts crying and hugs him, but suddenly emits a terrifying scream): Darling, darling, something is moving inside your backpack. 
-Man(turning around): What in the heck is that? ( He slowly approaches and touches it and the thing inside of it reacts at every touch)step back, step back it can be dangerous, I’m going to open the bag) He carefully opens the zip and the first thing that shows up is the cats head). 
-Man: Do you see that! 
-Woman: It is the cat! How it got in there!
-Man: I have no idea! I told you, this is a special critter! -Woman: Maybe it missed home! 
-Man: You never know with this thing. 
-Woman: Let’s throw a party to celebrate! 
-Man: Oh, yeah! 
                                             END
